# My bucket

This is a bucket for [Scoop](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop), includes some apps that I personally use.

If you want to install any apps from this bucket, just run:

```
scoop bucket add my-bucket https://github.com/zeemanz/my-bucket
```

## Notes

Some apps in this bucket that also exists in other buckets, they are different in some customized settings.

If you want to specify these app in this bucket, you should type command like this:

```
